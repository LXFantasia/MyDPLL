# MyDPLL
Realize simple DPLL by Python. **Too terrible to refer to**.  
The project is created to practise my Python, Markdown and Git skill. So it is very simple.  
My coding skill is **terrible**, so if you want to refer to some project to learn DPLL, please close this and see the next.

### Cons that may exist:
- Annotation written in **TWO LANGUAGES**
- **NONSTANDARD** script
- Algorithm found **ONLINE**
- Standard cnf files are **not allowed**
- All mistakes a noob might make  

### Future Arrangements:
- Change all the annoattions into English
- Simplify my script
- Through further study, make a genuine DPLL on my own

**PS:** The alogrithm I found online is against my initial imagination, so some of the lines are seemingly useless...
